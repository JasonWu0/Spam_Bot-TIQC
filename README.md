This is a simple spam bot that basically reads from a file you choose and essentially just enter the keys as if you typed them.
The for loop range can be changed in order to make more iterations of the words be entered.
As long as you click a feild to enter the words such as a text file or messaging the code should execute properly. 
There is an implemented fail safe if you want to stop the code at any point which can be activaited by bringing your mouse to the top left corner of your screen.
